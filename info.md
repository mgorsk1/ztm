# ZTM - Warsaw public transport sensor for Home Assistant
## Home Assistant (hass.io) custom component for Warsaw public transport.

This is continuation of work done by [@kabturek](https://github.com/kabturek). He was close to pull it as a official HA integration. You can find his pull request [here](https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant/pull/13561).

#### Description
The `ztm` sensor will give you information about departure times for bus/trams using [Warsaw Open Data](https://api.um.warszawa.pl/) API.

To access the data, you need an `api_key` that is provided after creating an account at [Otwarte dane po warszawsku](https://api.um.warszawa.pl/) -> Logowanie -> Rejestracja konta.

To activate the sensor you need the bus/tram `number`, `stop_id` and the `stop_number`. 
You can obtain `stop_id` and `stop_number` by searching for a stop at [ZTM](https://www.wtp.waw.pl/rozklady-jazdy/) website. 
In the url `wtp_st` param is the `stop_id` and `wtp_pt` param is `stop_number` (example stop: [Centrum 01](https://www.wtp.waw.pl/rozklady-jazdy/?wtp_dt=2020-01-30&wtp_md=5&wtp_ln=501&wtp_st=7013&wtp_pt=01&wtp_dr=B&wtp_vr=0&wtp_lm=1)).

<p class='note'>
You have to quote `stop_number` as it starts with the number 0.

#### Installation
[![hacs_badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/HACS-Default-orange.svg?style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/custom-components/hacs)

Download the files from custom_components/ztm into your $homeassistant_config_dir/custom_components/ztm

Once downloaded and configured as per below information you'll need to restart HomeAssistant to have the custom component and the sensors of ztm platform taken into consideration.

Then add the data to your `configuration.yaml` file as shown in the example:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
sensor:
  - platform: ztm
    api_key: YOUR_API_KEY
    lines:
      - number: 24
        stop_id: 5068
        stop_number: "03"
      - number: 23
        stop_id: 5068
        stop_number: "03"
```
#### Configuration:

I also advice to modify friendly_name for that sensor

The public data is coming from [Miasto Sto≈Çeczne Warszawa](http://api.um.warszawa.pl ).
